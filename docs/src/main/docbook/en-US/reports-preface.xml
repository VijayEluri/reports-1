  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
     The goal of Seam Reports is to provide a fully integrated CDI programming model portable
     extension for Java EE that provides APIs for compiling, populating and rendering reports from
     existing report frameworks.

  <para>
     Seam Reports contains similar functionality to that of the Excel and PDF templates of Seam 2, however, the
     creation and compilation of the reports is quite different. Seam Reports aligns much better with existing tools
     in a business, making use of knowledge and expertise that exists outside of development. The functionality in Seam
     2 was largely targeted to creating flyers and simple pages. Seam Reports can accomplish this, but also allows for
     easy creation of multi-page business reports by integrating with
     <ulink url="http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperreports">JasperReports</ulink>,
     <ulink url="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</ulink>, and
     <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/xdocreport/">XDocReports</ulink>. Integration with other reporting solutions
     can also be done easily by implementing five small interfaces provided by Seam Reports, see chapter 3 for more
     information about adding reporting engines.
