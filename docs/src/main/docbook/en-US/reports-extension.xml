    <title>Quick Start</title>
    <para>
      Extending Seam Reports is simple, and requires that you provide a qualifier annotation along with an implementation
      of the following interfaces:
    </para>
    <para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Report</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ReportDefinition</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ReportCompiler (optional)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ReportRenderer</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ReportLoader</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
		ReportCompiler should be implemented ONLY if your report framework allows you to compile reports. This is not the case for XDocReports, for example.
		In some cases, it may be the same implementation as the ReportLoader.
